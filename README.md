SeeItNow-js makes your web browser a better design tool.

* Adjust CSS values in your browser using property specific tools (currently, the only available tool is a live-updating color picker for changing background color)
* If you're running the (not yet written) NodeJS client...
	* values adjusted in your browser can be automatically applied to the correct stylesheets
	* values adjusted in one browser are automatically adjusted in any other browsers connected to the same page (letting you see results in multiple browsers instantly)

Current dependencies are jQuery, the jQuery hotkeys plugin, and Underscore. In some future actually-finished-enough-to-be-useful version, these will be included (and closure-wrapped for safety) automatically. For now, they must be included manually.

Once you have everything included and running, you can bring up the selector by pressing _ctrl+m_. Clicking on an element will bring up a color picker that adjusts that element's background color. Pressing _esc_ will deselect the element and hide the color picker.

This version is just a tech demo to get the very basics working, and so is a hideous mess.
